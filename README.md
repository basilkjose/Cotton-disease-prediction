## Overview

India is the largest producer of cotton in the world. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) pegs Indiaâ€™s cotton production at 29 million bales in the 2019-20 season as against 26 million bales the previous year. The latest figures mean that India is all set to surpass China, which has a projection of 27.75 million bales for the same season. However, despite these impressive numbers, the productivity per hectare is starkly low.The production of cotton in india reducing gradualy over year because of major cotton diseases which impact their production very much some common diseases like insect attack,charcol rot and many are making heavy impact over their plantation.Due to this many cotton cultivators farmer get a huge drop down in their production and income.The problem will be solved if the farmer get to know about the plants which are infected and diseased in early stages of their growth so that farmers can use pesticides and different medicinal equipments to sprinkles medicines over plants and save their crops from diseases in early stages of production.As this project will help the farmers to recognize the cotton plants which are Fresh and Diseased by simply uploading the pictures of the cotton plants on the web app.we can also use drone to capture realtime images and uploaded to web app
